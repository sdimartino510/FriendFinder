## Instructions
This app will compare your answers to a survey with answers submitted by a pre-determined list of "friends". It will then display the "friend" you match most closely with.

To get started, click on the "Get Started Now!" button. On the survey page that loads, enter your name and a link to your photo, then answer the survey questions that follow. Hit "submit". The friend that you match most closely with will display in a modal window.
